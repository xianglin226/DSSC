# Example constraints for training DSSC.  
Links are built from marker genes FABP7, PCP4, MOBP, AQP4, FABP4, CARTPT, ENC1, KRT17 and so forth.  
More marker genes can be added according to the prior knowledge or the aim of experiment.
Marker genes should be tested for spatial dependency and expression pattern before using for building constraints (see the R script for building constraints).
