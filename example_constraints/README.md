# Example constraints for training DSSC.  
Links are built from marker genes FABP7, PCP4, MOBP, AQP4, FABP4, CARTPT, ENC1, KRT17 and so forth.  
Marker genes should be tested for spatial dependency and expression pattern before using for building constraints (see the R script for building constraints).
